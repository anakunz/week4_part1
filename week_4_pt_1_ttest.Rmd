```

## 1. confidence intervals

t dist for greater uncertanty

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38,41,50, 27, 32, 41, 48, 60, 43)
t.test(otter_length)



```
this null is bogus: testing that mean otter length is zero, which makes no sense


## 2. T-test (1 sample t-test)

use `?t.test` for info (in console)

see claim: mean otter lengthis 50 inches

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu = 50) # reset the mean of 50 instead of null = 0
otter_test #call it to view


```

## 3. 2-sample T-test
are my differences in two sample means so different that i think they are drawn from populations with different means?


```{r}
desert_bighorn <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 40)
sierra_bighorn <- c(28, 31, 40, 42, 26, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorn, y = sierra_bighorn)

```
